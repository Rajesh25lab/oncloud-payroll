- Verify your email

**Step 3: Create a new repository**
- Go to: https://github.com/new
- Repository name: `oncloud-payroll`
- Make it **Private** (important!)
- Click "Create repository"

**Step 4: Upload files**
- On the repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
- Drag and drop the entire oncloud-payroll folder (or the ZIP)
- Click "Commit changes"

## OPTION 2: Even Easier! (I'll do most of the work)

If Option 1 seems confusing, I can:

1. Create a **StackBlitz** project (online code editor)
2. You just click a link
3. Click "Fork" 
4. Click "Deploy"
5. Done!

**Would you like me to create the StackBlitz version?** Just say "yes"!
